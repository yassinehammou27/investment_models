    "- generally the number of new housing permits was the lowest at around 2009 to 2010, the number of housing permits increased in fairfield county signifiacntly in the year 2011 and over shooted the number of housing permits in the other counties. However in the years before the housing permits was also on a high level in fairfield. The other counties where the number of new housing permits is also on a high level are new haven and hartford. For these it also makes sense, sinse they have higher populations compated to the other counties (excluding fairfax and fairfield county)\n",

    "- the house price index was very close together in the years before 2000 after that year the house price index rose much stronger in for fairfax county\n",
    "- overall we can see a peak of the house price index in 2006 and in the years after especially in the years 2007 to 2009 it decreased significantly and increased again in the recent years. Especially 2015 onwards\n",
