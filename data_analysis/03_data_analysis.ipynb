    "- mostly negative correlations between the distance geografix features and frequency geografic features. This makes sense because if the number of healthcare facilities in a 5 km radius is high. its is more likely that the distance to a hospital which is included in the healthcare facilies is small\n",
    "- besides that we have a great positive correlations between the different economic factors, such as betweeen the population and the number of employed persons. In this specific case this makes sense, because in bigger cities or counties with larger populations the total number of employed peope is more likely to be higher compared to counties with a very small population. However if we take a closer look there is not a big correlation between population and the unemployment rate. because the unemployment rate is relative to the population and therefore can differ form county to county without the population having a clear effect.\n",
    "- within the economic factors there are also some negative correlated features. Such as the poverty_rate and n_employed which economically also makes sense. if the poverty is high it is more likely that there are less employed people which generally indicates a negative economic state.\n",
    "the same is the case for economic factors such as unemployment_rate and household_incomre. A high unemployment_rate suggests a bad state of the economy and therefore it makes sense that the average household_incomre would be small.\n",
    "- another interesting point is that we have strong positive correlation between the house price index and the number of new housing permits. Since the house price index capture the price development of houses it makes sense if the prices for houses generally go up that also the interest to build a house or accuire a house increase. However the hpi does not seem to strongly correlated with other econmic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- another interesing thing is that we have a very strong correlation between an economic or demografic factor such as the population and some geografical distance features. \n",

This is probably or there tend to be there are maybe more railway stations in cities or counties with a higher population. therefore generelly the distance to railway stations would be smaller than in counties with a very low population. The same effect can be seen for the economic factor of number of employed people. this is also the case because we have a strong positive correlation between number of employed people and th population.\n",
