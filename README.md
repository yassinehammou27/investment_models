# Data

We have two separate data folders. The first folder is dedicated to the modeling process, containing the split datasets and model-specific data preparations. The second folder holds the raw data, along with the data resulting from the initial preparation, which was also utilized for data analysis.

The data has been uploaded and can be accessed via the following links:
